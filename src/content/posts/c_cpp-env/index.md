## macOS
### Method 1: Installing the Xcode command line tools

The clang and clang++ compilers come with the Xcode command line tools.

Note that when you run `gcc` or `g++`, it'll actually run `clang` or `clang++`.

To install the command line tools, use the following command.
``` Bash!
xcode-select --install
```
This will prompt for confirmation.

Click 'Install' to begin the download and installation process.

You'll see a confirmation message when installation is complete.

### Method 2: Homebrew

Alternatively, you can install and use the Homebrew package manager to install the gcc compiler.
  
To install the Homebrew package manager, use the following command.

``` Bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

You also want to add Homebrew to your PATH.

``` Bash
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

Homebrew is now installed!

To use Homebrew, restart your current shell to reload the PATH.

``` Bash
exit
```

You can now use Homebrew to install packages.
  
To install the gcc compiler, do:

``` Bash
brew install gcc
```

gcc will now be installed.
